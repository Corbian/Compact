#Installation instructions
Place the directory in \Steam\skins\. After you’ve extracted the contents of the archive you go to Settings › Interface and select the Compact skin.
#Linux users: Read the included readme for instructions how to install this skin on Linux. A few issues with fonts requires some manual work. Please let me know if you experience any issues with this, I haven’t tested it much myself.
