'Liberation Sans Digits Only' fonts set
is a subset made of 'Liberation Sans'
with FontForge.github.io ver. 2016-10-04 :

- digits U+0030 to U+0039 where untouched

- every glyph above U+0255 was nuked

- from U+0000 to U+0255, each existing
  glyph (except digits) was nuclear nuked,
  then radioactivity was eliminated by
  replacing them all by a null glyph with
  zero width (else font rendering engines
  substitute the missing glyphs by thoses
  in the default system font, which is
  not the intended behavior)

- kerning and pairing tables for CJK
  and Hebrew where removed for a
  whopping 5kb size reduction on
  the 4 font files
